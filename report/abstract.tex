This project aims to implement an existing heuristic algorithm for deriving classification rules upon range-based datasets as a Java programme. Its highlighted features including class value being used as a guide for its range search, alongside with an efficient method used to split ranges in order to find more accurate rules. The programme built for this algorithm will carry on those features with slight modifications when necessary.
