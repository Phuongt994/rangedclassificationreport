This project aims to implement an existing heuristic algorithm for deriving range-based classification rules in Java. Its highlighted features include using class values to guide its associated range search, accompanied by efficient methods used to split sub-ranges which help produce more accurate rules. The programme built for this algorithm will carry on those features with slight modifications in adaptation to the data structure of the chosen programming language.
