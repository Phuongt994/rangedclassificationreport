\chapter{Future Work}	

Firstly, the program could benefit from a revision in data structure within all classes. It also benefits from a simpification within recursive loop: Inheritance could be replaced by an independent class.

Secondly, once producing the right output, multi-threads could be implemented. Initial idea is to hand over each class and its data partition to each Java worker thread, which makes for a parallel structure in analysing ranges that could potentially make the program faster.

Thirdly, reconsiderations can be made upon how data could be partitioned. In this project, following the original algorithm, data is partitioned using max-sum method and an adjustment method to range cover. Alternatives could also be considered for this phase i.e max-miner approach \cite{maxminer}.
